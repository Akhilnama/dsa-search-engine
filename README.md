# dsa-search-engine
This project presents a search engine for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions. It involves an extensive scraping process, where 3500+ problems were extracted from LeetCode using Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup in Python. To ensure the data's cleanliness and usability, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) text processing libraries were employed for processing and cleaning the scraped information.

The core of the project revolves around the implementation of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, enabling efficient search functionality for the scraped DSA problems. By utilizing TF-IDF, the search engine determines the relevance of a query to each document in the database.
